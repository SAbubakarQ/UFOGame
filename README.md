## UFOGame

In this Codecademy project, functions were implemented. The use of functions and ASCII art was used. It contains three files: 'ufo.cpp', 'ufo_functions.hpp', and 'ufo_functions.cpp'. The game is a verison of hangman. Instead of hangman, your friend is being abducted by an alien spaceship! The user has less than seven strikes to try and guess the correct *codeword* before their friend is abducted. A hint of the codeword is the third word in this description with a bit of capitilization change.
